## Overview

The **Online Shop** project is a demo e-commerce application designed for Hackathon Phase 1. It serves as a platform to showcase best practices in code quality, development workflows, and system design with a focus on:

- **Git & GitHub:** Effective version control, branching strategies, and collaborative workflows.
- **Linux:** Command-line operations, system administration, and file management.
- **Docker:** Principles of containerization and preparing code for deployment in a containerized environment.

Your task is to familiarize yourself with the code, make enhancements if necessary, and ensure your final submission reflects your understanding of these topics.

---

## Guidelines & Resources

Before diving into the tasks, please review the following key resources:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): Guidelines for code contributions, commit messages, and overall coding standards.
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md): Insights into the project vision, future enhancements, and milestones.
- **Repository Documentation:** Explore the repository to understand how the application is built. Pay special attention to the `src` directory where the main application logic resides, as well as configuration files such as `vite.config.js` and styling in `index.css`.

These documents provide the context needed to understand the project requirements and the best practices expected for your contributions.

---

## Tasks

For this hackathon phase, your work will center around the following tasks:

### Git & GitHub

- **Repository Management:** Fork and clone the repository, then create a new branch for your work. Ensure your commit history is clean and well-documented.
- **Collaboration Practices:** Follow best practices for version control by making descriptive commits, creating pull requests, and engaging in code reviews.
- **Workflow Optimization:** Identify any areas where the Git workflow can be improved and document your suggestions for future enhancements.

### Linux

- **Command Line Proficiency:** Review the code for examples of Linux command usage. Test and verify that file operations, system scripts, and environment configurations are functioning as expected.
- **System Administration:** Examine how the application handles Linux-based operations such as permissions, file management, and process monitoring. If you see room for improvement, implement those changes and document them.
- **Documentation:** Clearly document any Linux-related enhancements you make, explaining how they optimize the project‚Äôs performance or usability.

### Docker

- **Containerization Principles:** Even though a Dockerfile is not provided in this repository, consider how you would package and deploy this application using Docker. Reflect on the design decisions that would facilitate containerization.
- **Conceptual Improvements:** Propose any modifications or improvements that could make future Docker integration smoother. Document your suggestions clearly in your pull request.
- **Code Readiness:** Ensure the codebase is structured in a way that aligns with Docker best practices, preparing it for eventual containerized deployment on AWS EC2 / Azure VM / Google Compute Engine (Your Choice of Cloud).
